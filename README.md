# hello-world

Today is Sunday, July 8, and I am learning GitHub for the first time. I've just moved to London and I an unemployed, so I'm trying to learn some new skills for my "next career."

I read somewhere that you're supposed to define your goals or you won't achieve them, so I guess I should define a goal or two or three (in order of priority, of course):

1. I want to find a job that offers flexibility and remote options.
2. I want to find a job that allows me to dress casually.
3. I want to figure out where I want to land within the field of tech (web development, programming, UX, etc.).
